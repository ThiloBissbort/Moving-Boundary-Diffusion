# Moving-Boundary-Diffusion
This repository contains two files that are 
- A MATLAB app installation that solves a 1D moving boundary diffusion problem using an analytical solution (error function) featuring a GUI.
- A MATLAB script that uses the same solution but can be modified by the user.

I am not responsible for any errors, mistakes, software or hardware problems that might be caused by using this program.
